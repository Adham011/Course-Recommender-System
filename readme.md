# Capstone Overview

In this capstone course, I applied various machine learning
knowledge and skills that I have learned as part of the previous
courses to solve some real-world industrial challenges.

## Project Scenario

Assume you are a new machine learning engineer in a Massive Open Online
Courses (MOOCs) startup called AI Training Room. In AI Training Room,
learners across the world can learn leading technologies such as Machine
Learning, AI, Data Science, Cloud, App development, etc. Your company
grows rapidly and reaches millions of learners in a very short period.

The learning topics of AI Training Room can be summarized in the
following word cloud:

Starting this year, your machine learning engineer team is working very
hard on a recommender system project. The main goal of this project is
to improve learners' learning experience via helping them quickly find
new interested courses and better paving their learning paths.
Meanwhile, with more learners interacting with more courses via your
recommender systems, your company's revenue may also be increased.

This project is currently at the Proof of Concept (PoC) phase so your
main focus at this moment is to explore and compare various machine
learning models and find one with the best performance in off-line
evaluations.

## Workflow

In this project tasks are summarized in the following workflow

More specifically, I undertook the tasks of:

- Collecting and understanding data
- Performing exploratory data analysis on online course enrollments
    datasets
- Extracting Bag of Words (BoW) features from course textual content
- Calculating course similarity using BoW features
- Building content-based recommender systems using various
    unsupervised learning algorithms, such as:
  - Distance/Similarity measurements, K-means, Principal Component
        Analysis (PCA), etc.
- Building collaborative-filtering recommender systems using various
    supervised learning algorithms
  - K Nearest Neighbors, Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF),
        Neural Networks, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression,
        RandomForest, etc.
- Creating an insightful and informative slideshow and presenting it
    to your peers


This project is a great opportunity to showcase my machine learning
skills, and demonstrate my proficiency to potential employers.


## Skills Network Labs

Skills Network Labs is a virtual lab environment reserved for the
exclusive use by the learners on IBM Developer Skills Network portals
and its partners.

## Use your local Python, Jupyter Notebook, and IDE

If you experience any issues with the above two cloud environments, you
may install Python and JupyterNotebook / JupyterLab on your own
environments like a desktop or laptop computer. All the notebooks and
data used in the capstone can be downloaded and executed locally.
